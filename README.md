My Data Journey with KMS: A Little Story

So, over the last few days, I’ve been diving into KMS’s sales data and wow, it’s been a ride.

We started with the basics:
Which product category is bringing in the most money?
I ran the numbers, grouped everything nicely, and we found the top-selling category. That gave the team a clear direction on where the real value was.

Then came shipping.
KMS was spending a lot and the big question was:
“Which shipping method is eating our budget?”
The data pointed straight at Express Air fast, yes… but definitely the priciest.

Now here’s where it got interesting.
We asked, “Are we using the right shipping method for the right priority?”
Turns out, some low-priority orders were being rushed through Express Air like they were emergencies. That’s like paying for first-class to deliver a pair of socks — not ideal.
So I recommended aligning shipping speed with order urgency.
Smart spending = better margins.
We didn’t stop there.
KMS wanted to know,
“Who are our best customers?”
So I pulled out the top spenders and even dug deeper into what they actually buy. No need for complex tables — just one clean dataset and the right filters.
And that gave us a clear picture of which people truly drive revenue.
Then we flipped the question:
“What about the customers at the bottom?”
I found them too and that opened the door for targeted promos, loyalty strategies, and win-back plans.
Along the way, I noticed something subtle.
Returns weren’t marked with a status column, but I spotted a pattern — negative profit. That was the clue!
Using that, I pulled out customers who returned items and even broke it down by segment.
It was like solving a little puzzle.
We also dealt with messy data like dates stored as text.
I cleaned that up and converted them into real date formats so we could run time-specific queries like:
“Which corporate customer placed the most orders between 2009 and 2012?”
Another win.
And finally, we made sure no customer type was overlooked.
I identified the top-performing small business customer, which helped give attention to a segment that often gets overshadowed by corporate clients.
In the end?
I didn’t just run queries. I helped tell a story — with numbers, patterns, and insights that actually matter to the business.
And honestly, it’s been fun turning raw data into real decisions.
